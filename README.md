# VirtualPetSuunnittelu

I'm making a virtual pet and wonder what to technologies to use. This project is for school and it's purpose is to learn using different libraries and then publish it. My teacher recommended me to use unity, c#, webGL, nextJS and vercel. What other libraries are necessary or is it possible to be done using those? Feel free to ask further questions to give a complete answer. Thank you in advice!





That sounds like an exciting project! Given your teacher's recommendation to use Unity, C#, WebGL, Next.js, and Vercel, you have a solid foundation for building and deploying your virtual pet game. However, depending on the features you want to implement, there may be additional libraries, tools, and frameworks you can consider using.

Key Components for Your Project:
Game Development (Unity + C# + WebGL):

Unity is a great choice for building the core game. It's versatile and supports both 2D and 3D games, making it suitable for interactive virtual pet games.
C# will be the primary scripting language in Unity. You'll use it for creating game logic, handling user input, managing game state, etc.
WebGL: Unity's WebGL export allows your game to run directly in a web browser. This is perfect if you want your game to be playable without requiring a separate download.
Frontend (Next.js):

Next.js will be used to build your website or frontend for interacting with the game. This could be where players set up their account, manage their pets, or even track their progress.
Next.js is great for building fast, server-side-rendered React applications, which could make your virtual pet's website user-friendly and performant.
You could also integrate authentication, user profiles, and API calls to interact with the backend (if needed) for saving user progress.
Deployment (Vercel):

Vercel is a solid choice for hosting the frontend (Next.js app). It's optimized for frontend frameworks like Next.js and offers seamless deployment.
Unity WebGL builds can also be deployed via Vercel, but keep in mind that large game files may require additional configuration or storage solutions.
Additional Libraries and Tools to Consider:
Here are some additional tools and libraries you might consider based on common needs for virtual pet games:

1. Backend (Optional)
If you want users to have persistent data (e.g., their pet's stats, progress, etc.), you'll need a backend service. You could:
Firebase: An easy-to-integrate solution for user authentication (via Firebase Auth) and real-time database (via Firestore or Realtime Database). It’s simple and works well with Next.js.
Supabase: An open-source alternative to Firebase. It provides real-time databases, authentication, and more, with a SQL-based backend.
Node.js + Express: If you want to build a custom backend, using Next.js with an API route can work well, or you can set up a full backend with Node.js and Express.
2. UI/UX Libraries:
Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework that can speed up frontend development for your Next.js app.
React: Since Next.js is built on React, you might want to leverage libraries like React Spring (for animations) or Framer Motion (for smooth animations) to create engaging pet animations and UI elements.
React Query: For handling API requests and managing the pet's state and progress in the backend.
3. Game Features (Optional):
If you plan to make the pet interactive, you may want additional libraries or tools for the virtual pet interactions:
PlayFab: A backend-as-a-service tool specifically designed for game developers. It provides services like player data storage, leaderboards, achievements, etc.
Photon: If you want to add multiplayer capabilities (such as multiple users interacting with pets), Photon is a great option for real-time multiplayer features.
4. Data Storage and Persistence:
For saving pet data (e.g., pet stats, levels, etc.), you could store this in a cloud database like MongoDB or SQLite (if you're using a custom backend with Node.js).
Cloud Storage: If your game uses images or other media assets (for pet appearances, backgrounds, etc.), you might want to store them on cloud services like AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, or even Firebase Storage.
5. Analytics and Monitoring:
Google Analytics: If you want to track user engagement with your virtual pet game, using Google Analytics will help you gather valuable insights about how users are interacting with your app.
Sentry: If you want to track errors or bugs in your Unity WebGL build or Next.js frontend, Sentry provides real-time error tracking.
Steps to Build Your Virtual Pet Game:
Create Game in Unity:

Start by designing the core mechanics of your game. Define what kind of interactions your virtual pet will have (feeding, playing, etc.).
Implement C# scripts to handle game logic and user input.
Export your game to WebGL format (Unity has built-in support for this).
Develop Frontend with Next.js:

Build your user interface (UI) where users can manage their pet(s).
Use React to manage the UI state (pet health, happiness, etc.).
Set up routing and pages in Next.js to navigate through different screens (pet dashboard, settings, etc.).
Connect Backend (Optional):

Use a backend service (like Firebase or Supabase) to save game data (e.g., user profiles, pet stats).
You can create API routes in Next.js to interact with the backend for saving and retrieving data.
Integrate Unity with Next.js:

Embed your Unity WebGL game into your Next.js site. You can use an <iframe> or a Unity-specific integration method to display the game in the browser.
Consider using React Unity WebGL to help you integrate Unity with React, allowing you to manage Unity objects from your React code if necessary.
Deploy with Vercel:

Deploy your Next.js app and Unity WebGL build to Vercel for hosting.
Ensure your Unity WebGL build is optimized for web performance (e.g., reducing file size, loading times).
Final Thoughts:
The stack your teacher recommended (Unity + C# + WebGL, Next.js, Vercel) is sufficient for building a fun and interactive virtual pet game, but depending on the complexity of your game, you might find additional libraries or services useful. Most importantly, focus on your core learning objectives—working with Unity and WebGL, building a frontend with Next.js, and understanding how to deploy a web application.

If you have specific ideas for features (e.g., multiplayer, pet evolution, etc.), let me know, and I can suggest more targeted libraries!
